// Cplusplus-Clock Project

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a clock program that displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. 
The program allows users to interact with the clock by adding or subtracting hours, minutes, or seconds to adjust the time manually. 
This project solves the problem of simulating a real-time clock with user interaction in a console environment.

// What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I implemented time manipulation effectively, allowing users to adjust the displayed time in a seamless manner. 
The program efficiently switches between 12-hour and 24-hour formats without needing to reset the time, ensuring smooth functionality.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
I could enhance the code by adding input validation to ensure that only valid numbers are accepted when adjusting the time. 
Additionally, integrating a real-time clock feature using system time would make the program more dynamic and realistic.

// Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging piece was handling the switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats while keeping the program user-friendly. 
I overcame this by thoroughly testing the logic and using conditionals to handle time overflow scenarios (e.g., converting 24-hour time to 12-hour format). 
I referred to online C++ documentation and used course materials for guidance on formatting the output.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
I think I will use my skills in time manipulation, conditionals, and format conversions in future projects. 
This project also helped me improve my ability to design user-interactive programs, which is applicable in many software development scenarios.
