// Cplusplus-Temperature Converter Project

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a temperature converter program that allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 
The program takes user input for a temperature and converts it to the opposite unit of measurement. 
It solves the common problem of quickly converting temperatures in scientific or daily use scenarios.

// What did you do particularly well?
I handled the conversion logic efficiently, ensuring that the conversion formulas for Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa were applied accurately. 
The program also included clear prompts and outputs, making the interaction easy for users to understand and use.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
I could enhance the program by adding support for more temperature scales, such as Kelvin, to increase its versatility. 
Additionally, I could implement input validation to ensure users enter valid temperature values, preventing invalid conversions.

// Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging part was ensuring the output was correctly formatted for both Fahrenheit and Celsius, particularly with decimal places. 
I overcame this by using precision formatting in C++ and testing various edge cases to ensure accuracy. 
I relied on standard documentation and online resources to ensure proper conversion formulas were used.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The skills in handling user input, performing mathematical conversions, and formatting outputs will be transferable to any future project that involves user interaction or mathematical operations. 
This project also helped reinforce my understanding of basic C++ syntax and logic structures.
