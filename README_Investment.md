// Cplusplus-Investment Program

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I developed an investment calculator program that calculates the future value of an investment based on user input. 
The program asks for the initial investment amount, monthly contributions, and annual interest rate, and then computes how the investment will grow over time. 
It solves the problem of providing users with a simple tool to visualize their long-term financial planning based on compound interest.

// What did you do particularly well?
I implemented the mathematical formulas for compound interest accurately, ensuring that the program outputs precise values for future investment growth. 
The user interface was intuitive, allowing users to input different variables and immediately see how their investment would change over time.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
I could enhance the program by adding data validation, such as checking for negative or unrealistic values for inputs like interest rates or contributions. 
Additionally, extending the program to allow for different compounding intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly) would provide more flexibility for users.

// Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was implementing the compound interest formula correctly across different time intervals. 
I overcame this by breaking the formula into small, manageable parts and testing each section of the code. 
I referred to finance tutorials and mathematical resources to ensure accuracy in the calculations.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The skills from this project—particularly in mathematical computation, user input handling, and financial modeling—will be useful for future projects that involve numerical calculations. 
Additionally, designing a user-friendly interface helped me develop better user interaction principles for future software development tasks.
