// Cplusplus-Corner Grocer Project

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I developed an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which allows users to track the frequency of items purchased. 
The program reads a file containing a list of items and counts how many times each item has been purchased. 
It then outputs this information in both a list format and a histogram, allowing the user to see trends in item purchases.

// What did you do particularly well?
I handled file input and output efficiently, ensuring the program could read large datasets from the input file without issues. 
The histogram display was implemented well, giving a clear and visual representation of the frequency of purchased items.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
I could enhance the program by adding user input validation to handle cases where the input file might be missing or corrupted. 
Additionally, implementing a sorting mechanism for the output list could make it more user-friendly by showing items in order of frequency. 
Improving the code to handle larger datasets with optimized algorithms would also enhance performance.

// Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging part was managing the dynamic counting of item occurrences in the dataset. 
I overcame this by using data structures such as maps to store the frequency of each item. 
I relied on online tutorials and documentation for handling file input and output in C++.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The skills I gained in file handling, data structures, and visual representation of data will be highly transferable to other projects involving data processing. 
This project also reinforced my understanding of reading and manipulating external data sources, a critical skill in software development.
