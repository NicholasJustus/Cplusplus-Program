# Cplusplus-Program
// Cplusplus-Calculator Project

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The program allows the user to input two numbers, select an operation, and displays the result. 
This project solves the problem of performing quick mathematical calculations in a console environment.

// What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I was particularly successful at handling user input and ensuring the program could handle division by zero gracefully. 
The input/output operations were handled efficiently, and the program was structured for easy use.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
I could enhance this code by adding more advanced mathematical operations, such as exponentiation and square roots. 
Additionally, restructuring the program into modular functions would make it more maintainable and easier to debug in the future.

// Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging piece was managing invalid user input without crashing the program. 
To help me with this project, I used exception handling and loops to prompt the user to re-enter valid input. 
I also used online C++ resources and course materials to improve input validation.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
I think I will use my skills in user input validation, arithmetic calculations, and control structures in future projects. 
This project also helped me improve my ability to handle errors and ensure smooth program execution under unexpected conditions.
